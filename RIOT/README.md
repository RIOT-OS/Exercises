# RIOT - README

This folder contains several exercises and tasks to get familiar with RIOT, the
friendly operating system for the Internet of Things (IoT) [1], [2]. RIOT is an
open source project and aims to foster usage of open standards, technologies
and protocols in the IoT.

The exercises are grouped into folders each covering a certain topic. Not all
tasks start from scratch, thus they may rely on or reference other tasks.
